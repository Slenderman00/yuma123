Package: netconfd-module-ietf-traffic-generator
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, debconf, lsb-base (>= 3.2-13), libyuma2 (>= 2.15),
 traffic-generator-cli
Description: SIL module for netconfd implementing ietf-traffic-generator.yang
 .
 Implements the functionality modeled in ietf-traffic-generator.yang using
 the available traffic-generator CLI tool.

Package: traffic-generator-cli-rawsocket
Architecture: any
Provides: traffic-generator-cli
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, debconf, lsb-base (>= 3.2-13), traffic-generator-make-testframe
Description: CLI tools starting traffic generator stream and a traffic analyzer on local network interface.
 .
 This package contains a rawsocket implementation of the traffic-generator-cli interface. It is not as deterministic
 as alternative hardware based implementations. It also serves as a template and is universally supported
 on all Linux machines with generic interfaces supporting SOCK_RAW.

Package: traffic-generator-make-testframe
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: CLI tools printing the hexadecimal data of a traffic generator testframe according to parameters.
